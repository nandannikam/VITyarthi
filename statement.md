Problem Statement :-
  The goal is to create a simple, text-based ATM (Automated Teller Machine) simulation program in Python. This program will let users       carry out basic banking transactions once they have successfully logged in.

Scope of the object :-
  This ATM Simulation project is all about simulating the main stuff a bank terminal does, using basic Python. It keeps user info (like     passwords and balances) in a list while the program runs, but it forgets everything when you close it. It helps you to perform all the    operations in the same manner which you can perform into a real ATM. It performs various banking operations like Cash withdrawl,cash      deposite, check balance and change your password. It's all done through a text-based screen. It works on in-built database already the    uses are fixed.

Target Users :-
  Anyone of us can use the simulation as we all need to use ATM to perform transactions.

High-level features :-
  The program has two high level features. First one is it is a password protected simulation, you can't perform any of the transaction     without giving correct username and password, hence anyone with only correct user details can perform transactions. Second the            simulation also gives option to update the password which is reflected immediately in the user database and from the next login user      has to use new password.
